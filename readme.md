# A little WPF app I'm working on in my spare time that shows your battery power (in your laptop) as hearts.

Can be dragged to where you want it.

Rightclick -> exit to close.

Here's what it looks like for now:

5 Hearts total. Background is transparent so it shouldn't really clash with anything.

## Still to do:
- Show percentage as a tooltip.
- Show charging state.
- Testing :-)
